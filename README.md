5. Delete key()

* **_Assignment 5:_**
Implementation of *Position Heap Data Structure* and perform following operations 
1. Build Position Heap 
2. Query position Heap.

* **_Assignment 6:_**
Implementation of *Skip List* to maintain student database such as Name, Roll_Number, Marks, Phone_number using skiplist and perform 
1. insert()
2. search()
3. delete()
4. find_nth_smallest()
find_records_within_range()//E.g. from roll_no 20 to roll_no 35 et. all


* **_Assignment 7:_**
Implementation of *Point-Region Quadtree* to perform following operations.
1. Create()
2. Search()
3. RangeQuery()//this function will take the input as rectangular query region and returns the set of points falling inside or on the boundaries of the rectangular query region.
