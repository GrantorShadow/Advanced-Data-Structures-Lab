### ___Advanced-Data-Structures-Lab-Projects___
--------------------------------
Repo for Assignments & Projects done for *IT203TLP ~ Advanced Data Structures, VIT, Pune.*

UPDATE NEEDED

* **_Project 1:_**
Implemented a Text editor which has set of commands to perform different operations. Made a matching User will input initial characters of command, your program should list the possible set of commands matching the prefix entered by the user. user will select required command from the list and perform the required operation.Suggest and implement suitable data structure to store the set of commands.

* **_Project 2:_**
Project On: Single Source All Destination Shortest Path Algorithm Using Fibonacci Heap Data Structure
Single Source shortest path using Fibonacci Heap
Implement the single source shortest path algorithm(Dijkstras Algorithm ) Using Array data structure as well as using Fibonacci heap . However use adjacency list rather than matrix . Generate 10 undirected graphs with different edge density . each graph should have number of nodes N >500 .Assign random costs to the edges between [1-1000] .measure the run time of the two implementations of the shortest path algorithm. Plot the average time for each N

* **_Project 3:_**
Project : Database Indexing using B tree and B+ Tree
For the student database given in the excel sheet, build the index considering Gr Number as a key for the database,using btree or b+tree.
your program should search the record of the student given his/her GR.NO as input.

* **_Project 4:_**
Project: Simulation of Tree MAP interface available in Map API in Java
Simulate the Working of Tree Map interface available in java API with the help of RED Black tree.
refer:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html

* **_Project 5:_**
Project Statement:- Implementation of RED BLACK TREE by using Multi threading technique
PLZ read the paper attached here to implement Multi threaded implementation for 
insert
search 
update 
delete operations on red black tree
